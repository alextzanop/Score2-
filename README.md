# Score2!

This is my version of the Score 4 board game with some additional features

# How to play
You can either download the solution or go to https://www.csd.uoc.gr/~math5370/Score/main.html in which it's currently hosted.

# Rules
- The game lasts 4 rounds. The person to win most rounds wins the game.
- Get 4 beads of the same color in a row to win a round. That means 4 in the same row, column or diagonal.
- Earn additional points if you manage to get 5 or 6 in a row!
- Earn additional points if you manage to reach the win condition with multiple ways. That is, 4+ beads in a row on a line and a column, or a column and a diagonal or even a line, a column and two diagonals(yea, good luck)!
